# CNN_MNIST

Convolutional neural net for image recognition on the classic MNIST data set.
Uses Keras with a TensorFlow backend to build the convolutional net.

Program also applies "dropout" to help prevent over-fitting to the training data set.

After training, the model is able to predict the hand written digit with over 99% accuracy.
